# Resources for learning more about AWS

Aside from AWS resources, there is a wealth of additional information regarding AWS available on the internet. Below are some of our favorite non-AWS resources.

AWS Newbies is an excellent location to begin your learning journey if you are entirely new to AWS. The website was founded in 2018 by the owner while studying for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner test, and it has since helped many others learn about AWS.

100DaysOf Cloud is an open community dedicated to helping people improve their Cloud computing abilities.

### AWS certification and training

In addition to the free digital training provided by AWS, you may attend a premium classroom or online course organized by an authorized AWS Training Partner. What's the distinction? You will receive trainer assistance from an AAI (Authorised AWS Instructor) during training by an approved AWS Training Partner, whether in-classroom or online, which is not the case with AWS' digital training courses. The teachers have real-world experience in the industry and like sharing their knowledge and practical tips and techniques with their pupils.

Booking a course with an authorized training partner may be a smart option if you feel stuck or if you need some extra help when acquiring new AWS skills. The Campus is also an approved AWS Training Partner. 

### Begin with the AWS program.

The Campus has created a free 'Get Started with AWS Programme' that will teach you how to become an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner] in only 11 days. Our program consists of a series of emails (don't worry, we won't spam you!) that contain the material and connections to AWS resources you'll need to become an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. We will begin with the fundamentals of cloud computing and then move on to AWS. You may sign up for the free program here.
